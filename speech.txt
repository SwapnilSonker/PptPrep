Early Life and Family Background
Kylie Jenner was born into the famous Kardashian-Jenner family, which is known for its involvement in reality television, business ventures, and social influence. She is the youngest daughter of Kris Jenner, a media personality and businesswoman, and Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce Jenner), a former Olympic gold medalist and television personality.
Kylie has one full sister, Kendall Jenner, and several half-siblings from both her parents' previous marriages, including Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian, from her mother’s side, and Burton, Brandon, and Brody Jenner from her father’s side. Growing up in this large, high-profile family gave Kylie early exposure to fame and media attention.
In 2007, when Kylie was just 10 years old, her family’s reality TV show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, debuted on the E! Network. The show followed the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family members and soon became a cultural phenomenon. Though her older sisters, especially Kim Kardashian, were initially the focal points, Kylie and her sister Kendall began gaining their own fan bases as they grew up in the spotlight.

Reality TV and Early Public Life
Kylie’s fame can be attributed to her involvement in Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Audiences watched her grow from a quiet and shy child into a confident young woman. During her teenage years, Kylie started gaining attention for her unique sense of style, which included experimenting with hair colors, fashion, and makeup trends that influenced millions of fans.
As a teenager, Kylie began monetizing her fame by endorsing various products, from clothing lines to accessories, and collaborating with brands like PacSun and OPI. These early partnerships not only introduced her to the business world but also showcased her potential as a trendsetter in fashion and beauty

The Social Media Sensation
Kylie’s fame truly skyrocketed when she began utilizing social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Snapchat, to connect with her growing fan base. With her increasing popularity, Kylie began to develop her personal brand, which focused on her love for beauty and fashion.
She became a major influencer, sharing her daily life, beauty routines, and new makeup looks with her followers. By her late teens, she had tens of millions of followers across social platforms, making her one of the most followed individuals in the world.
Her ability to engage with her audience and promote her image through social media became the key to her entrepreneurial success. Kylie was among the first celebrities to fully realize the potential of social media as a business tool, which allowed her to bypass traditional marketing strategies and reach her fans directly.

The Birth of Kylie Cosmetics
In 2015, Kylie Jenner made a bold business move by launching Kylie Cosmetics, starting with her iconic Kylie Lip Kits. The lip kits included a lip liner and liquid lipstick in a set, aimed at replicating Kylie’s signature plump-lip look, which had become one of her trademarks.
The idea for Kylie Cosmetics came from her passion for makeup, particularly lip products. She often credited her love for beauty and her desire to help others feel confident as her motivation for starting the brand. Using her massive social media following, Kylie announced the launch of her lip kits, which sold out within minutes of going live.
The success of Kylie Lip Kits proved that Kylie had the power to turn her personal image and style into a lucrative business. This single product launch quickly evolved into a full-fledged beauty empire. Kylie Cosmetics expanded to include a variety of products, such as eyeshadows, blushes, highlighters, and more.
Key to Success:
Social Media Marketing: Kylie Cosmetics’ early success can be attributed largely to Kylie’s use of social media for marketing. She built hype by teasing product launches, engaging directly with fans, and creating demand with limited releases.
E-commerce Model: Kylie Cosmetics was initially sold exclusively online. This direct-to-consumer model allowed her to cut overhead costs by avoiding the need for brick-and-mortar stores and to reach a global audience

The Growth and Expansion of Kylie Cosmetics
After the initial success of the lip kits, Kylie steadily expanded her product offerings and brand presence. Each product launch was accompanied by viral marketing campaigns on her Instagram and Snapchat accounts, which her millions of followers eagerly anticipated.
In 2018, Kylie made a strategic decision to partner with Ulta Beauty, a major beauty retailer, to bring Kylie Cosmetics to physical stores across the U.S. This partnership significantly increased her brand’s accessibility and contributed to a massive spike in sales. The move into retail was seen as a significant moment for the brand’s growth, as Kylie Cosmetics reached an even wider consumer base.
Product Line Expansion:
Kylie Cosmetics introduced several makeup lines, including eyeshadow palettes, lip glosses, blushes, and more.
In 2019, she diversified her business further by launching Kylie Skin, a skincare line that included products such as face washes, moisturizers, and serums.


Forbes and The “Self-Made” Billionaire Controversy
In 2019, Kylie Jenner was named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire by Forbes at the age of 21. This title was based on the massive success of Kylie Cosmetics, which had generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. However, Forbes’ classification of Kylie as “self-made” sparked controversy, with many arguing that her family’s fame and fortune gave her a significant advantage.
Despite the criticism, Kylie’s business acumen and ability to capitalize on her social media influence were undeniable factors in her success. Kylie addressed the debate by acknowledging the privilege her family name provided but emphasized her own role in building her cosmetics empire.


The Sale to Coty and Business Expansion
In 2020, Kylie made headlines again by selling 51% of Kylie Cosmetics to the global beauty conglomerate Coty Inc. for $600 million. This deal valued her company at approximately $1.2 billion. While Kylie retained a role as the face and creative director of the brand, Coty’s involvement allowed the company to scale internationally and expand its distribution networks.
The sale to Coty allowed Kylie to further invest in expanding her product lines and exploring new business opportunities, such as Kylie Baby, a line of baby care products she teased in 2021. Her ability to diversify her business interests demonstrated her long-term vision as an entrepreneur.

Kylie is also known for her philanthropic efforts. Over the years, she has supported numerous causes, including:
Donating to Children’s Hospitals: Kylie has contributed to hospitals in Los Angeles, funding critical care units and child development programs.
COVID-19 Relief: During the pandemic, she donated $1 million to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers.
Support for Black Lives Matter: Kylie has also been vocal in supporting social justice causes, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, using her platform to advocate for change.
In her personal life, Kylie has a daughter, Stormi Webster, born in February 2018, with rapper Travis Scott. The birth of Stormi was a significant moment in Kylie’s life, and she chose to keep her pregnancy private, only revealing the news after Stormi’s birth in a heartfelt video.
